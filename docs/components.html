<h1>Components<a class="headerlink" href="#components" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>The application is build from multiple components, every one of them with a well defined role. As a generic overview, the first component that user interacts with is the GUI, that reads the input from the fields or from the XML file and then sends it to the expression parsers component that interacts with the big number in order to compute the expression. After the expression is computed the result is returned to the user to be desplayed in GUI or written to file.</p>
<section id="gui-component">
<h2>GUI Component<a class="headerlink" href="#gui-component" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The component is responsible with all the I/O operations between the user and the application. There a two ways of interacting with the GUI:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>directly through GUI input fields.</p></li>
<li><p>indirectly through XML files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More details presented on <a class="reference internal" href="how_to_run.html"><span class="doc">how to run</span></a> page.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Backend interaction.</strong> The interaction between backend and the frontend is made using the class <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BackendBridge</span></code> defined in <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ui_bridge.py</span></code>, using the two methods available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>method <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exponent(...)</span></code> that implements a getter for the internal exponent data field used to populate field <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Exponent</span></code> on initialization.</p></li>
<li><p>method <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compute_data(...)</span></code> that calls the needed backend method in order to compute the math expression provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Input validation.</strong> The input is always readed directly from the GUI fields, so there is a uniform way of validating data before sending it to the backend. Because of this, when an XML is loaded, the actual data is first set into the GUI fields in order to be readed leater. The actual data validation is made for every field in the associated setter/getter methods.</p>
<p><strong>Data constraits.</strong> Every field has some basic constraints in order to verify the input data as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>field <strong>Exponent</strong>: expects a non-zero unsigned integer.</p></li>
<li><p>field <strong>Expression</strong>: expects a non-empty arithmetic expression that contains only the alphanumeric characters and the characters <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+-*/()^%</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>field <strong>Variable Name</strong>: expects a non-empty string of length 1 that matches the character set <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[a-zA-Z]</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>field <strong>Variable Value</strong>: expects a unsigned integer smaller the maximum number defined by the exponent.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Expression Parser Component<a class="headerlink" href="#expression-parser-component" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This class takes care of parsing and solving mathematical expressions, respecting the mathematical order of operations and offering a simple interface.</p>
<p>It has 3 components: tokenizer, parser and solver. The overwhelming majority of compilers and parsers implement this approach making it a well-known solution throughout the decades.</p>
<p><strong>I. Tokenizer</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any expression parsing is the operation of tokenization on the input string. The tokenizer is a standard way of splitting the input in several smaller pieces, that are logically grouped in tokens.
In the current implementation, a token can have any of the following types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Number: any piece of text that contains only ascii digits in a consecutive order;</p></li>
<li><p>Variable: an identifier, must start with a letter followed by letters and digits;</p></li>
<li><p>Sqrt: an ident that spells the word sqrt.</p></li>
<li><p>Double star: any consecutive characters that are double stars;</p></li>
<li><p>Plus, minus, slash, star, percent, open paren, closed paren: the corresponding characters, always has the size of 1;</p></li>
<li><p>End: this token is found only once in the token stream and it marks the end of the stream. It is generated by the tokenizer and it doesn’t actually point to a valid location in the input string.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Spaces (including newlines, tabs and unicode defined spaces) are ignored by the tokenizer, as they do not offer any information to the next steps of the process and are supported just for convenience of the user.</p>
<p>The tokenizer will also reject any characters that it finds and are invalid for a mathematical expression. At this point, the tokenizer will throw an exception when it finds any such invalid character that will tell that it’s invalid, but it won’st tell any other information. It might be desirable in the future to add a more descriptive error to this exception or even rework the error mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>II. Parser</strong></p>
<p>After the tokenizer is finished and completes successfully, its output is taken by the parser; this is a python array containing the token objects.</p>
<p>The parser will try to make sense of it, not unlike what compilers for most programming languages do. It will check for the next token in the series and construct an apropriate structure for that place in location.</p>
<p>The output of the parser is a tree that can be made out of several nodes, each node representing an operation in the expression. The following node types exist at this moment:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>NumericExpr: hosts a literal(hardcoded) number value; it corresponds to the number token type from the lexer;</p></li>
<li><p>VariableExpr: contains the name of the variable that is used in the expression. The name is not checked if it exists in the variables list at this point, and can be any string that matches the requirements for the ident token;</p></li>
<li><p>UnaryExpr: represent a unary operation - an operation that takes only one parameter. The unary operations are described in the enum UnaryOperator. The only unary operation existing at this point is the square root;</p></li>
<li><p>BinaryExpr: represents a binary operation - an operation that that is composed of two expressions and an operator that specified the behavior. The operators are described in the BinaryOperator enum;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To figure the order operation on a depth level for the binary operations, the parser uses a relatively simple algorithm that searches of the lowest priority operator, splitting the expression in two around that operator.</p>
<p>The parser checks at every point it can that the expression is correct and will throw a number of exceptions if it detects an invalid expression. An invalid expression can be an expression that has a different number of open and closed parens, a unary or binary operation that doesn’t terminates, etc. The parser will also check for unreachable code and will assert if any such code gets to be executed.</p>
<p><strong>III. Solver</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the lexing and parsing phases that at the end produce a tree representing the original input string, a third step is needed, the one where the expression is actually solved.</p>
<p>The solver needs two things as its input: the root of the expression tree, and a dictionary representing the names and the values of the variables. The only requirements for this dictionary are that it contains all the variables used in the expression and its values are the same number type that the lexer has been initialized it. Having more variables in the dictionary is not an error, but having less is.</p>
<p>The role of the solver are to solve the equation, generating a single result value and generating the steps that were needed to generate that value.</p>
<p>The solver will do multiple iterations until the final single result is ready. At every iteration, the solver will try to calculate the leftmost operation that has all its arguments known. At the end of each iteration, the solver will generate a human readable string of the current state of the partially solved equation.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight-text notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>2 ** (1 + 2 * x - 3 / sqrt y)          =&gt; original expression
(2 ** ((1 + (2 * x)) - (3 / sqrt y)))  =&gt; the expression showing the tree order of arguments
(2 ** ((1 + (2 * 2)) - (3 / sqrt y)))  =&gt; x=2 was replaced in 2 * x
(2 ** ((1 + 4) - (3 / sqrt y)))           =&gt; 2 * 2 = 4
(2 ** (5 - (3 / sqrt y)))                    =&gt; 1 + 4 = 5
(2 ** (5 - (3 / sqrt 9)))                    =&gt; y=3 was replaced
(2 ** (5 - (3 / 3)))                             =&gt; 3 / 3 = 1
(2 ** (5 - 1))                                      =&gt; 5 - 1 = 4
(2 ** 4)                                               =&gt; 2 to the power of 4 = 16
16
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the end, the result and the string with the steps are returned.</p>

<h2>Big Number Component<a class="headerlink" href="#big-number-component" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>This class represents a custom implementation that operates with big numbers, which are stored internally in an array for fast operations.</p>
<p>There is a standard soft limit of 1000 digits per number regarding the output of the operations, but also the intial value attributed to a BigNum instance, which can be modified by the user.</p>
<p>This class implements all basic operations that would be needed in calculating an expression, and can take either an int or a string as input in the constructor.</p>
<p>The internal representation of a BigNum is an array of Base10 digits, stored in reverse order, which help the implemented algorithms for faster calculations without intermediary steps regarding the data representation.</p>
<p>This class is used by the Expression Parser component for evaluating parsed expressions.</p>
